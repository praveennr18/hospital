## 📋 Test Requirements

### Environment Setup
- Make sure `.env` file is properly configured
- Django server should be running for API tests
- Database should be populated with test data

### Dependencies
- All tests use the same environment variables as the main application
- Tests require valid authentication tokens for API testing

## 🔧 Test Configuration

Tests use environment variables from `.env` file:
- `API_BASE_URL` - Base URL for API testing
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging level for test output
- Authentication credentials for various user roles

## 📊 Test Coverage

Current test coverage includes:
- ✅ Appointment scheduling (multiple user roles)
- ✅ Permission validation (role-based access)
- ✅ Logging system verification
- ✅ API endpoint validation

## 🔮 Future Tests

Planned test additions:
- Unit tests for models
- Integration tests for complex workflows
- Performance tests for API endpoints
- Security tests for authentication

**Note**: These are functional tests that interact with the actual API. For unit testing, consider using Django's built-in testing framework.
